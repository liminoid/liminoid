# Getting Help

Liminoid is a very new project and it is likely that some things will break, errors will be thrown, and the documentation won't make sense.... but we can make it _better/faster/stronger_ together ðŸ¦¾

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/liminoid) is the most sustainable place (i.e. content with longevity) to find, ask, and answer questions about **using** Liminoid.
- The [chatroom](https://discord.gg/6FdvJka) is for anything that doesn't fit into a **well defined question**, quick clarifications, or when you **don't know where else to go**.
- Repository [issues](https://github.com/liminoid) are for **bugs** in the code itself (or technical errors). If you find one please report it there so we make sure to **fix it** and it gets **distributed for everyone**.
