# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Liminoid](https://github.com/liminoid) üôè A good first step is saying hello in the [chatroom](https://discord.gg/6FdvJka). A good second step is figuring out how you might want to contribute!

## Ways to Contribute

Contributing doesn't mean having to write code‚Ñ¢ and it is often the other (less tangible) contributions that really make a project successful (and fun):

1. [Spread the word](#spread-the-word)
2. [Help others](#help-others)
3. [üîéüêõüêûüêú](#find-bugs)
4. [Committing code](#committers-guide)

Regardless of how you want to get involved, please note that this community follows and enforces an inclusive [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). By participating you agree to abide by its terms.

</Box>

## Spread the word

The _easiest_ way to contribute is by spreading the word! This could be sharing a project you built with Liminoid, telling a friend who might be interested, or chiming in on social media [@liminoid_io](https://twitter.com/liminoid_io) ü§ó

## Help others

The most _impactful_ way to contribute is by helping others. You could write a tutorial or guide on how to use Liminoid, improve the documentation, or answer questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/liminoid).

## Find bugs

If you find a bug or have a suggestion on how to make Liminoid better, first check the issues of the relevant sub-project on [Github](https://github.com/liminoid). If there isn't an existing outstanding issue, feel free to inquire in the [chatroom](https://discord.gg/6FdvJka) or create a new issue.

## Committers' Guide

If you would like to help develop Liminoid, a good starting place is to familiarize yourself with the [sub-projects](https://github.com/liminoid) to figure out how/where you might want to contribute. Looking at any of the existing issues in any of the repositories can provide more bite-sized tasks and writing more tests is a gentle way to familiarize yourself with the code. Before working on fixing a bug, developing a new feature, or writing code, ask if anyone is already working on something similar in the [chatroom](https://discord.gg/6FdvJka) to find potential collaborators and to prevent duplicating work.

### Setting up your environment

Each repository may have slighty difference development dependencies (listed in `package.json`) but generally any pacakge that is:

- **bundled** uses [ES6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
- **transpiled** uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with the latest [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) syntax enabled.
- **formatted** uses [Pretttier](https://prettier.io/) for styling and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting (loosely following Airbnb's [guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript))
- **documented** uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (and Markdown) for integrating components into the documentation.

The [colophon](/colophon/) is also a good reference of the libraries and pacakges that Liminoid uses.

### Versioning

TLDR; from https://semver.org/:

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
